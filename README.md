BUMP

The Directory (dir) allows publication, exchange, and discovery of information about records over a distributed peer-to-peer network.
It leverages [OASF](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf) to describe AI agents and provides a set of APIs and tools to store, publish, and discover records across the network by their attributes and constraints.
Directory also leverages [CSIT](https://github.com/agntcy/csit) for continuous system integration and testing across different versions, environments, and features.

## Features

ADS enables several key capabilities for the agentic AI ecosystem:

- **Capability-Based Discovery**: Agents publish structured metadata describing their
functional characteristics as described by the [OASF](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf).
The system organizes this information using hierarchical taxonomies,
enabling efficient matching of capabilities to requirements.
- **Verifiable Claims**: While agent capabilities are often subjectively evaluated,
ADS provides cryptographic mechanisms for data integrity and provenance tracking.
This allows users to make informed decisions about agent selection.
- **Semantic Linkage**: Components can be securely linked to create various relationships
like version histories for evolutionary development, collaborative partnerships where
complementary skills solve complex problems, and dependency chains for composite agent workflows.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Built on proven distributed systems principles,
ADS uses content-addressing for global uniqueness and implements distributed hash tables (DHT)
for scalable content discovery and synchronization across decentralized networks.
- **Tooling and Integration**: Provides a suite of command-line tools, SDKs, and APIs
to facilitate interaction with the system, enabling developers to manage Directory
records and node operations programmatically.
- **Security and Trust**: Incorporates robust security measures including
cryptographic signing, verification of claims, secure communication protocols, and access controls
to ensure the integrity and authenticity of Directory records and nodes.

## Prerequisites

To build the project and work with the code, you will need the following installed in your system

- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.24.0)

Make sure Docker is installed with Buildx.

## Development

Use `Taskfile` for all related development operations such as testing, validating, deploying, and working with the project.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agntcy/dir
cd dir
```

### Initialize the project

This step will fetch all project dependencies and prepare the environment for development.

```bash
task deps
```

### Make changes

Make the changes to the source code and rebuild for later testing.

```bash
task build
```

### Test changes

The local testing pipeline relies on Golang to perform unit tests, and
Docker to perform E2E tests in an isolated Kubernetes environment using Kind.

```bash
task test:unit
task test:e2e
```

## Artifacts distribution

All artifacts are tagged using the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and follow the checked-out source code tags.
It is not advised to use artifacts with mismatched versions.

### Container images

All container images are distributed via [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/agntcy/packages?repo_name=dir).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/agntcy/dir-ctl:v0.3.0
docker pull ghcr.io/agntcy/dir-apiserver:v0.3.0
```

### Helm charts

All helm charts are distributed as OCI artifacts via [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/pkgs/container/dir%2Fhelm-charts%2Fdir).

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/agntcy/dir/helm-charts/dir --version v0.3.0
```

### Binaries

All release binaries are distributed via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases) and [Homebrew](./HomebrewFormula/) `agntcy/dir` tap.

### SDKs

- **Golang** - [pkg.go.dev/github.com/agntcy/dir/client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/agntcy/dir/client) - [github.com/agntcy/dir/client](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/client)

- **Python** - [pypi.org/agntcy-dir](https://pypi.org/project/agntcy-dir/) - [github.com/agntcy/dir/sdk/dir-py](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/sdk/dir-py)

- **JavaScript** - [npmjs.com/agntcy-dir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agntcy-dir) - [github.com/agntcy/dir/sdk/dir-js](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/sdk/dir-js)

## Deployment

Directory API services can be deployed either using the `Taskfile` or directly via the released Helm chart.

### Using Taskfile

This will start the necessary components such as storage and API services.

```bash
task server:start
```

### Using Helm chart

This will deploy Directory services into an existing Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/agntcy/dir/helm-charts/dir --version v0.3.0
helm upgrade --install dir oci://ghcr.io/agntcy/dir/helm-charts/dir --version v0.3.0
```

### Using Docker Compose

This will deploy Directory services using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd install/docker
docker compose up -d
```
